Role Testing Demo
=================

This is a demonstration of how to test an Ansible role. The role itself is borrowed from [geerlingguy.elasticsearch](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy.elasticsearch). When executed the role will install ElasticSearch.

We utilize [TravisCI](http://travis-ci.org) to execute the role and run tests. The execution of the role and testing occurs in tests/test.yml, which is inspired by [chrismeyersfsu.provision_docker](https://github.com/chrismeyersfsu/provision_docker).
